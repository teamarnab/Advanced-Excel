# Advanced Excel Formulas Practice

## Description
This project contains an Excel sheet where six different situations have been created to practice and apply advanced Excel formulas. These formulas cover a wide range of scenarios and help in understanding how to use Excel functions for complex tasks, data analysis, and reporting.

## Features
- The Excel sheet includes 6 different situations where advanced formulas are applied.
- Formulas demonstrate usage of functions like VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, SUMIFS, IF, nested functions, and more.
- Each sheet focuses on solving specific problems with practical use cases.
- Learn to automate data analysis and reporting using advanced Excel functions.

## Situations Covered
1. **Data Lookup**: Using `VLOOKUP` and `INDEX-MATCH` to retrieve data from a table.
2. **Conditional Calculations**: Applying `SUMIFS` and `COUNTIFS` for conditional summing and counting.
3. **Nested Functions**: Combining multiple functions in one formula to solve complex problems.
4. **Text Manipulation**: Using text functions like `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, `TEXT`, etc.
5. **Date Functions**: Calculating date differences, adding days, and extracting parts of dates.
6. **Financial Calculations**: Using formulas for financial analysis, such as `PMT`, `FV`, and `NPV`.
